/// data and parameters which are sent to it.

/// Recommended conformance of this protocol is implemented using `struct`. It is
/// of course possible using `enum` or `class`. Endpoints are are not designed
/// to be referenced and used instantly after creation, so no memory usage is required.
/// The case for not using enums is long-term sustainability. Enums tend to have many
/// cases and information about one endpoint is spreaded all over the files. Also,
/// structs offer us generated initializers, which is very helpful
